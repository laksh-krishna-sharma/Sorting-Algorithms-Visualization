# Sorting Algorithms Visualization
This project provides visualizations of two popular sorting algorithms: Selection Sort and Bubble Sort. The visualizations are implemented in C++ using the graphics.h library, allowing users to observe the sorting process step by step.

# Overview
  Selection Sort:
  The Selection Sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: one that is already sorted      and one remaining subarray of unsorted elements. In each iteration, the smallest element from the unsorted subarray is selected and swapped with the element at the beginning of the unsorted subarray.

  Bubble Sort:
  Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its 
  name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list with each pass.

# Features
 Visual Representation: 
      The program visually represents the sorting process by drawing lines on a graphical window, where each line represents a number in the array being sorted.
 Step-by-Step Sorting:     
      Users can observe how the sorting algorithms work by seeing each step of the sorting process visually.
# Requirements
C++ compiler supporting the graphics.h library.
bits/stdc++.h for standard C++ libraries.
chrono for generating random numbers.
# Acknowledgments
The graphical visualization is inspired by various educational resources on sorting algorithms (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort).
Special thanks to the authors of the graphics.h library for providing a simple interface for graphical programming in C++.
